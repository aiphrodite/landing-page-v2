With the digital landscape evolving rapidly, brands must keep up with trends and demands for personalized, high-quality content. Leveraging AI for creative asset optimization can be a game-changer, enhancing both the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing campaigns. aiphrodite.ai utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and optimize creative assets based on a target audience. Launched less than a year ago, and we are seeing a ton of exciting places clients are using our tool. The place that many clients buzz about is in usage for RFPs, pitches, and briefs.

#### But in all transparency, we have no clue how to measure the success and why this works, it is all anecdotal evidence thus far.

Still, we wanted to share three ways our clients are using AI Personas to enhance their workflow. So enjoy a peek into how some of our clients are using AI Personas to enhance their workflow.

## 1. Target Audience Understanding in RFPs

#### Quick Audience Insights for Better RFPs

Marketers are able to use AI Personas to better understand which audiences are best to target with each creative, drafting RFPs that set client expectations early on. This also allows for quick and easy experimentation with different audiences to see which are most likely to convert and engage.

## 2. Product Highlights in Pitches

#### Putting the "why" behind each creative.

When the desired copy is set, AI Personas can help identify the most effective visuals that feature the product and convey such messaging visually. This ensures that the pitch resonates with the target audience and highlights the features that are most likely to drive engagement and conversions.

## 3. Better Briefs

#### Less notes, more action.

> in the past, this would be an entirely subjective, qualitative process. we sat in a room with a set of stakeholders reviewing a set of key images and selecting which ones we believe corresponds best.

Heatmaps can be generated in seconds to simulate where people are looking without any need for live humans. Stakeholders can quickly align and put fears and reservations to rest. Custom models can also assure brand guidelines are met from logo placement to color schemes.

## Conclusion

aiphrodite.ai has shown to be a powerful tool for pitches, RFPs, and brief in a thus far unquantifiable way. We are currently measuring time spent, hours saved, and user experience regarding in following areas:

* Alignment with traditional market research methods (up to 100% parity)
* Time to audience insights (up to 10x faster)
* Number of won contracts (not enough data for a hypothesis yet)
* Fewer meetings between stakeholders (up to 16 human hours saved per campaign)

and are excited to share our findings in the near future.
