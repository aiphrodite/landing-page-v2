## Introduction

For those unfamiliar with Harvard Business Review (HBR), it stands as a trusted authority in the realms of digital transformations and marketing for. HBR's content is grounded in rigorous research, often conducted by leading experts and peer-reviewed for quality. Of course trailing its namesake, its longstanding reputation for excellence has solidified its credibility among business professionals, executives, and academics. HBR's focus on practical implications ensures that readers gain actionable insights applicable to real-world scenarios. In summary, HBR's combination of research rigor, credibility, practical insights, and global outlook contributes to its status as a trusted source in the business world.

Recently associate professor Rubén Mancha and professor Salvatore Parise of Operations and Information Management at Babson College published the following:

> Today, the problem most companies face in executing their digital transformation is not access to technologies but a shortage of workers with digital and data science skills. The demand is growing faster than the supply. In other words, recruitment can only get your company so far. To get the rest of the way, companies need to commit to training and upskilling, giving employees opportunities to learn about technologies — and room to experiment (and fail) with them.

## The Digital Transformation Journey

The article highlights the importance of digital transformation in today's business landscape. It emphasizes the need for companies to invest in their employees' digital and data science skills. But while the authors recognise that the demand for these skills is growing faster than the supply, and that recruitment alone cannot solve the problem, upskilling is not a broadly applicable solution. Not everyone has the aptitude or interest in learning data science skills. From our years as educators, we know the uphill battle of trying to teach someone who is not interested in learning. It is a waste of time and resources for both the teacher and the student.

Teams should rely on tools to supplement gaps. We've seen amazing progress recently in this front as ChatGPT has helped employees cross small gaps in their skills. It's a great example of how AI can be used to supplement human skills. Those who see it not as a replacement, but as a  supplement, are the ones succeeding the workplace today.
