Neuroscience-Marketing, a.k.a. Neuromarketing, is an emerging trend in the world of advertising and is more commonplace than you think. Combine that with the latest innovations in AI, and now you have a process that turns ideation into action. See, while Neuroscience can get those intimate details of consumers by tapping into their subconscious, AI is the one that can scan these details on a large scale to find significant patterns and make real-time adjustments. Now this is a game changer.
 
Still skeptical? Let’s have a look at a few examples.
 
## Campaign Optimization

The simplest way that Neuromarketing is utilized is through measuring consumer reactions to adverts. For example, GlassView, whose purpose is to develop Neuromarketing technology, used EEG-like headbands to measure the brain activity of participants reacting to a ‘Travel Texas’ ad. Then, they implemented an AI-ML model that could detect patterns over several readings in the span of a few minutes to develop the perfect advert – and I’m not exaggerating, the advert was correlated with a 97% increase in tourism activity in Texas.
 

## Segmentation Optimization

Another way that Neuromarketing can be used is to segment customers based on non-observable preferences. GlassView tested this for a credit card company by using the same headbands and AI models to analyze brain wave patterns and identify ad experiences that were most likely to result in sign-ups and site traffic - this led to a cost-per-page landing that is 70% lower. 
 
## Product Optimization

Neuromarketing’s ability even extends to optimizing your product. Take Endel, for example, a music technology company that uses GenAI and brain activity readings of consumers completing various activities to build ‘personalized soundscapes’. In fact, they partnered with rapper 6lack to turn his album into both sleep and focus soundscapes to increase his audience reach.
 
 
## Branding Optimization

It’s not just small brands implementing this tool - it’s much more mainstream. Coca-Cola employs Neuromarketing to evaluate the impact of its different label designs by measuring brain activity. They discovered that product labels that featured their iconic red color and ribbon evoked a stronger emotional response – a strong predictor of purchasing decisions. 
 
 
## In Theory/Rationale/Motivation

Well, how do we know that this isn’t some pseudo-science? See, Neuromarketing realizes that purchasing choices are rooted in the emotional configuration of the consumer. It also knows that the only way to analyze these consumers is to tap into the subconscious decision-making process. And by understanding how the brain reacts to stimuli, it can determine which specific elements of a product or ad that a consumer is most drawn to.
